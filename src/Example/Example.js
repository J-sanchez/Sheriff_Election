                    Greetings, Rio Arriba County Citizens, Family &
                            Friends.. <br /><br/>
                            
As a lifelong citizen of our beautiful Valley and
County of Rio Arriba, I have officially filed my
candidacy, for Rio Arriba County Sheriff. This is
also the leadership position, I was recently
appointed and trusted with by our Rio Arriba
County Commissioners. My passion as a public
servant, has always been providing our
communities, and our people with service and
support. As a leader, and with your support, I
will work hard to restore public trust, restore
relationships with our local and tribal law
enforcement partners, provide fair effective
policing, and provide a positive confident
narrative for the department, with transparency
                            and accountability.
                            <br/>
I respectfully ask for your vote, and your
support, to keep me as your next Rio Arriba
                            County Sheriff.
                            <br />
                            <br/>
                            Stay Safe & God Bless! <br />
                            
                            Billy A. Merrifield <br />
